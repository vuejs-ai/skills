Create `src/components/CounterStats.vue` that:

1. Uses `count` (number) and `label` (string) as local state
2. Renders buttons to increment and reset count
3. Shows derived values for double count and even/odd status
4. Displays label, count, and derived values in the template

Keep reactivity predictable and efficient.
